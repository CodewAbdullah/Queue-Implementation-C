# Queue Implementation in C

This project is a simple CLI-based implementation of the **Queue data structure** using C. It supports basic operations like **enqueue**, **dequeue**, **peek**, and **display**. Built to help solidify understanding of queues, array manipulation, and user interaction in terminal applications.

## 🔧 Features

- ➕ **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- ➖ **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- 🔍 **Peek**: View the front element without removing it.
- 📜 **Display**: View all elements currently in the queue.
- ⚠️ **Overflow/Underflow Handling**: Prevent invalid operations with proper error messages.
- 🔁 **Menu System**: Simple text-based UI to select operations repeatedly.
